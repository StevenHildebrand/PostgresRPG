(1,'Druidic','Animal Friendship','Enchantment/Charm','10''','Permanent','1 normal animal','V, S, M','6 turns','Negates','The animal friendship spell enchants a normal animal of neutral alignment to become the druid''s faithful friend and companion. The animal to be enchanted must not be completely unintelligent but cannot be of greater than animal intelligence. If the animal fails its saving throw (made at the beginning of the spell''s casting), it will remain docile for the remainder of the casting time. Once the spell is complete, the animal will remain with the druid and can learn tricks similar to those that could be taught to a well-trained domestic pet. Each trick takes a week to learn, and after the animal has been with the druid for three months it will no longer be able to learn new tricks. During this period, if the animal is left alone by the druid for more than three days, the enchantment will be broken and the animal will revert to the wild. A druid may only have animal friends with hit dice totalling twice his or her level. (The total hit dice can thus increase as the druid gains levels.) ','Common','OSRIC',54,'','',''),

Creatures threatened in this manner are entitled to a saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature''s movement rate is slowed to half normal; if the saving throw fails, the creature is so securely held in the plants that it cannot move, attack, or cast spells for the duration of the spell. ','Common','OSRIC',59,'','',''),
(1,'Druidic','Faerie Fire','Transmutation/Alteration','80''','4 rounds/lvl','1 medium or 2 small creatures/lvl','V','3 segments','None','The druid uses this spell to ignite a fiery-looking aura of bright light around his or her enemies. The aura is visible at a range of 80 ft if the observer stands in darkness, and at 40 ft if he or she stands near another light source. The light itself is harmless, but a creature limned with faerie fire is easier to hit; any attacks against it are made with a bonus of +2. ','Common','OSRIC',59,'','',''),
(1,'Druidic','Invisibility to Animals','Illusion/Mirage','Touch','1 turn+turn/lvl','Creature touched','S, M','4 segments','None','With a gesture, the druid or other recipient of the spell fades from the sight, sound, and smell of any animal (i.e. creature listed under "Animal" in Chapter V). Creatures with intelligence of 6+ are not affected by the spell. This powerful form of invisibility is not dispelled if the druid attacks, although a particular creature being attacked with a hand-held weaponwill, of course, be aware of the druid''s general location and be entitled to attack with a –4 penalty until the druid moves out of its immediate area. Druids will, by nature of their calling, not use this spell to commit wholesale slaughter upon animals except in extraordinary circumstances. ','Common','OSRIC',61,'','',''),
(1,'Druidic','Locate Animals','Divination','Caster','1 round/lvl','20''x20'' path/lvl','V, S, M','1 round','None','The caster becomes able to divine the presence of a particular kind of animal in the direction he or she views. The druid must concentrate for a full round in a particular direction in order to gain the insight granted by the spell. The spell''s enchantment affects the caster, so the effects move with him or her. The divination is not blocked by any intervening substance, of any thickness. ','Common','OSRIC',62,'','',''),
(1,'Druidic','Pass Without Trace','Enchantment/Charm','Touch','1 turn/lvl','Creature touched','V, S, M','1 round','None','Any creature upon which this spell is cast can move through any sort of terrain without leaving behind the slightest sign of its passage. It leaves no footprints, no scent, and no other telltales of movement. It is impossible to trace its path except, temporarily, by one method—the path will radiate magic for 6d6 turns. Once this time elapses, the magical aura will fade away, leaving the trail undisturbed by any sign that the spell''s recipient was ever there. ','Common','OSRIC',62,'','',''),
(1,'Druidic','Predict Weather','Divination','0','Instantaneous','9 sq. miles','V, S, M','1 round','None','The druid casts this spell upon virtually any substance: bones, leaves, powders, etc. He or she can read in the resulting pattern an exact divination of the weather as it will naturally occur within the surrounding nine square miles for the next two hours per caster level. A second level druid, as an example, would be able to predict the weather four hours into the future.  ','Common','OSRIC',63,'','',''),

(1,'Druidic','Shillelagh','Transmutation/Alteration','Touch','1 round/lvl','1 oak club','V, S, M','1 segment','None','The druid imbues a club or billet of oak-wood with enchanted power, making it +1 to hit and capable of inflicting 2d4 points of damage against small and medium-sized opponents, 1d4+1 against large opponents. The shillelagh must be wielded by the druid in order for it to possess these magical properties; in the hands of any other person it will be no more than an ordinary wooden club. ','Common','OSRIC',65,'','',''),
(1,'Druidic','Speak With Animals','Transmutation/Alteration','0','2 rounds/lvl','1 animal within 40'' of caster','V, S','3 segments','None','This spell allows the druid to speak with all animals of a particular type or species that are within 40 ft of him or her when the spell''s casting is complete. In all other respects, except as denoted above, the spell is identical to the second level cleric spell speak with animals. ','Common','OSRIC',55,'','',''),
(2,'Druidic','Barkskin','Transmutation/Alteration','Touch','4 rounds+1 round/lvl','Creature touched','V, S, M','3 segments','None','The barkskin spell magically toughens a creature''s skin, making it as strong as tree bark. The recipient of the spell improves his or her armour class by one point and also gains a +1 bonus on all saving throws, with the exception of saving throws against Spells (unlisted categories). ','Common','OSRIC',55,'','',''),
(2,'Druidic','Charm Person or Mammal','Enchantment/Charm','80''','See text','1 person or mammal','V, S','4 segments','Negates','The powerful enchantment woven by this spell will affect any "person," meaning character races (with the exception of elves) and other small to medium-sized bipeds analogous to persons (orcs, goblins, etc.). The spell also affects mammalian animals of any kind, even those that are supernatural, giant, or monstrous. If the target creature fails a saving throw, it will view the druid as a trusted friend, interpreting his or her every word in its most positive light. Charmed creatures will place themselves into moderate danger, including combat, on the druid''s behalf, but will not undertake risks beyond those the creature might ordinarily take. The druid must be able to talk to the charmed creature if he or she is to make any sort of complex "request." Charmed creatures are allowed periodic saving throws to break the charm, based on intelligence:   19+ one saving throw/ day  18 one saving throw/ 2 days  17 one saving throw/ 3 days  15-16 one saving throw/ week  13-14 one saving throw/ 2 weeks  10-12 one saving throw/ 3 weeks  7-9 one saving throw/ month  4-6 one saving throw/ 2 months  3 or less one saving throw/ 3 months   The charm will be broken automatically if the druid obviously tries to harm the charmed creature.

(2,'Druidic','Create Water','Transmutation/Alteration','10''','Instantaneous','<1 cu.ft./lvl','V, S','1 turn','None','Other than as described above, this spell is similar to the clerical spell create water.

(2,'Druidic','Cure Light Wounds','Necromancy','Touch','Instantaneous','Creature touched','V, S, M','4 segments','None (Negates)','The druidic cure light wounds is, except as described above, identical to the clerical spell of the same name. ','Common','OSRIC',58,'','',''),
(2,'Druidic','Feign Death','Necromancy','10''','4 rounds+2 rounds/lvl','1 creature','V, S, M','3 segments','None','With the exception of any distinctions detailed above, this spell is identical to the magic user spell of the  same name. ','Common','OSRIC',59,'','',''),

(2,'Druidic','Heat Metal','Necromancy','40''','7 rounds','Special','V, S, M','4 segments','None','This extremely powerful spell causes metal to heat up to searing temperatures, and the reverse, chill metal, causes metal to become damagingly cold. The two versions of the spell inflict different damage and potential side effects. The spell will affect all metal worn by one size M creature per caster level, or 50 lbs weight/ caster level, as applicable.  The effects of continued exposure to the metal as it changes temperature to a damaging level and then returns to normal are set forth below:   heat  Round 1        No effect other than discomfort  Round 2        1d4 hp damage  Rounds 3-5   2d4 hp damage, severe blistering to extremities (hands, feet), and unconsciousness if a helmet  Round 6         1d4 hp damage  Round 7         Discomfort   cold  Round 1          no effect other than discomfort  Round 2         1d2 hp damage  Rounds 3-5    1d4 hp damage, severe frostbite (possible need for amputation of extremities; fingers, ears)  Round 6         1d4 hp damage  Round 7         discomfort   Immersion in water will negate the effects of the heat version of the spell, and magical protections against the appropriate elements will negate both versions. If no such options are available, the target of this spell is well advised to spend a round divesting him-or herself of metal gauntlets and helmet at the very least, to avoid the side effects. ','','',0,'','',''),
(2,'Druidic','Locate Plants','Divination','Caster','1 turn/lvl','5'' radius/lvl','V, S, M','1 round','None','Upon casting this spell, the druid is imbued with the ability mentally to locate any specific type of plant upon which he or she concentrates, in the area the spell radiates around him or her as he or she moves. ','Common','OSRIC',62,'','',''),
(2,'Druidic','Obscurement','Transmutation/Alteration','0','4 rounds/lvl','10''x10'' cube/lvl','V, S','4 segments','None','As this spell is completed, an enchanted mist billows from the area where the druid stands, rapidly filling the area of effect and reducing visibility therein to 1d4 x2 ft. The spell is affected by natural conditions such as strong winds, which will reduce the spell''s effective duration. ','Common','OSRIC',62,'','',''),
(2,'Druidic','Produce Flame','Transmutation/Alteration','0','2 rounds/lvl','See text','V, S, M','4 segments','See text','On casting this spell, the druid''s hand ignites with an eldritch fire that causes no harm to the druid but is otherwise equivalent to the flame of a torch. It can be used to set fires and may also be thrown as a missile. The throwing range of the flame is 40 ft, and when the flame hits an object it will explode, igniting all combustible material in a radius of 15 ft. (Materials are entitled to saving throws against normal fire.) The druid may banish the magical flame at will, but fires set by it must be extinguished by normal means. ','Common','OSRIC',63,'','',''),
(2,'Druidic','Trip','Enchantment/Charm','Touch','1 turn/lvl','1 object < 10'' long','V, S, M','4 segments','Negates','This spell turns an appropriate object into a magical trap of sorts. The object rises from the ground and trips any creature crossing over it, even if they are aware of it (saving throw vs spells—unlisted category, +4 if aware of the object). The object is 80% undetectable and will affect even the caster. The trap causes falls to be much worse than normal: a running creature will suffer 1d6 points of damage and be stunned for 1d4+1 rounds, or will merely be stunned if they fall onto a soft surface such as grass. Creatures larger than size M are not affected by the spell. ','Common','OSRIC',66,'','',''),
(2,'Druidic','Warp Wood','Transmutation/Alteration','10''/lvl','Instantaneous','See text','V, S, M','4 segments','None','This spell permanently warps wood and may be used to destroy arrows, spears, doors, etc. The druid may affect a volume of wood roughly fifteen inches long by one inch thick per caster level, about the volume of an axe handle. Multiple items may be affected; four arrows have about the same volume as an axe handle. A fifth-level druid could effectively destroy a normal door with this spell. ','Common','OSRIC',67,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Call Lightning ','Transmutation/Alteration','0','1 turn/lvl','360'' radius','V, S, M','1 turn','Halves','Provided that there is already significant cloud cover in the area, the druid may use this spell to call down a shattering barrage of lightning bolts from the sky to the ground. One bolt may be called every turn (10 minutes). The bolts inflict 2d8 points of damage, plus another d8 per level of the caster. Any creature within 10 ft of a bolt''s impact (or along its downward path) will sustain damage. The spell may only be cast outdoors. ','Common','OSRIC',55,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Cure Disease','Necromancy','Touch','Instantaneous','Creature touched','V, S, M','1 round','None (Negates)','This spell, with the exception of any distinctions noted above, is identical to the clerical spell cure disease. ','Common','OSRIC',58,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Hold Animal','Enchantment/Charm','80''','2 rounds/lvl','1d4 animals','V, S, M','5 segments','Negates','A hold animal spell completely immobilises up to four animals (i.e. creatures listed under "animal" in Chapter IV) for the length of the spell''s duration. The druid decides how many animals he or she will target with the spell: if there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –4; if two, each makes the saving throw at –2; if three, the saving throw is at –1; and if the druid seeks to hold four animals, each makes its saving throwwith no penalty. Animals held by this spell may be killed or bound at a rate of one per round, or, if the attacker chooses, may be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit, for maximum damage.

(3,'Druidic','Plant Growth','Transmutation/Alteration','160''','Permanent','20'' x 20'' square/lvl','V, S, M','1 round','None','By means of this spell, the druid causes plants and vines to grow with unbelievable speed, forming a tangled barrier of thick vegetation. The enchantment may be dispelled, or the plants cleared by normal means. Chopping a way through the barrier is possible, but movement is restricted to 10 ft/ turn (20 ft for size L creatures).','Common','OSRIC',63,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Protection from Fire','Abjuration','Touch','See text','1 creature','V, S, M','5 segments','None','The druid may use this spell to confer considerable protection from fire upon another creature, but if he or she casts it upon him-or herself the effects are far greater, conferring temporary invulnerability even to fires of magical nature, such as dragon''s breath. If the spell is cast upon another creature, the recipient gains immunity to normal fire and a saving throw bonus of +4 against fire based attacks. Any damage incurred by fire attacks will also reduced by half. If the spell is cast upon the druid, he or she becomes completely invulnerable to normal fire and also ignores all damage from magical fire (dragon breath, fireball, etc.) until a total of 12 hp/caster level has been absorbed by the spell, at which time the spell will be dissipated. ','Common','OSRIC',63,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Pyrotechnics','Transmutation/Alteration','160''','See text','See text','V, S, M','5 segments','None','The pyrotechnics spell may be used to produce two entirely different effects: a bright display of fiery light or a massive pall of smoke. Both possible uses of the spell require an existing fire source (which may be anywhere in the spell''s range), and the spell''s area of effect depends on the size of the originating fire.   If the spell is used to produce fireworks, the flashing display will temporarily blind (for 1d4+1 rounds) all creatures in the area of effect and 120 ft beyond—provided that the display is not obstructed from view, of course. The fireworks fill an area ten times the volume of the original fire source and persist for 1 segment/ caster level.   If the spell is used to produce smoke, a billowing cloud will emanate from the fire source, obscuring vision beyond 20 ft in an area 100 times the volume of the fire source. Whatever fire is used as the spell''s source is extinguished immediately as the spell is cast. ','Common','OSRIC',64,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Snare','Enchantment/Charm','Touch','Permanent until triggered','10'' +6''/lvl radius','V, S, M','3 rounds','None','This spell is used to enchant a normal snare, making it hard to detect and supernaturally effective. The spell is cast upon a rope, vine, or cord, which then blends perfectly with the surroundings, becoming 90% undetectable to normal (unenchanted) vision. When any creature steps into the area bounded by the snare, the snare will whip closed and bind the victim tightly. Strength of 23 is required to break the snare for one hour after the spell is triggered, and the strength required falls by one point per hour until 12 hours have elapsed, at which time the spell ceases to have any effect. If the snare is attached to a suitably flexible tree, the spell will magically bend the tree so that when the trap is triggered it will snap the victim into the air for 1d6 points of damage and hold it suspended from the branches.','Common','OSRIC',65,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Stone Shape','Transmutation/Alteration','Touch','Instantaneous','3 cu. ft. +1''/lvl','V, S, M','1 round','None','This spell is identical to the magic user spell of the same name, except as noted above. ','Common','OSRIC',65,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Summon Insects','Conjuration/Summoning','30''','1 round/lvl','See text','V, S, M','1 round','None','When the druid completes the intonations and gestures of this spell, a swarm of insects appears from nearby or from the thin air to attack the druid''s enemies. There is a 70% chance that the swarm will be composed of flying insects, 30% chance that the insects will be ants or other non-airborne biting vermin. A flying swarm can move tremendously fast, but a crawling swarm is  limited to movement of 12 ft/ round. In either case, the insects automatically inflict 2 hp damage per round against their target, and the unfortunate victim will be so thickly covered as to be incapable of any action, including movement. The druid may redirect the swarm to attack another opponent, but the command will cause 1 round of confusion within the swarm as it reorients itself toward the new target. ','Common','OSRIC',65,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Tree','Transmutation/Alteration','Caster','6 turns+1 turn/lvl','Caster','V, S, M','5 segments','None','Casting this spell causes the druid''s shape to melt and twist into that of a tree, its general appearance determined by the caster. The spell is neither an illusion nor a charm: the druid is, for all intents and purposes, a tree. However, in tree shape the druid retains human senses and will be fully aware of his or her surroundings. The druid may shift back into human shape at will, thereby ending the spell. Magical detections will reveal the druid''s true form, but ordinary inspections, no matter how minute, will not.','Common','OSRIC',66,'','',''),
(3,'Druidic','Water Breathing','Transmutation/Alteration','Touch','6 turns/lvl','1 creature','V, S, M','5 segments','None','This spell grants the ability to breathe underwater while the spell lasts. The reverse of the spell allows a water-breathing creature to breathe in the air. ','Common','OSRIC',67,'','',''),
(4,'Druidic','Animal Summoning I','Conjuration/Summoning','120''/lvl','See text','See text','V, S, M','6 segments','None','A druid may use this spell to summon normal or giant animals of a specified type. The animals must be within the spell''s range to be summoned. Up to three summoning attempts may be made if animals of the specified type do not appear. Assuming that the summoned type of animal is within the spell''s range, up to 8 animals will appear, of no more than 4 hit dice each. These animals will assist the druid with a specific mission: winning a battle, travelling to a specific location, etc. ','Common','OSRIC',54,'','',''),

The druid casts the spell by means of a sonorous chant, which he or she must continue for 2 turns or until the summoned creatures appear. The GM will determine if creatures that will respond to such a call are in the area. The creatures are entitled to a saving throw vs Spells (unlisted categories) at a penalty of –4. If the creatures fail the saving throw and are summoned to the druid''s aid, they will provide whatever aid they are capable of, although their willingness to engage in combat is subject to their overall reactions to the druid him-or herself.   If there is an evil character in the druid''s party, the summoned creatures gain an additional saving throw to avoid the effects of the spell, at a bonus of +4. Creatures that may be summoned by this spell include:  Centaurs   1d4  Pixies        1d8  Fauns       1d4  Treant       1  Unicorn   1 ','Common','OSRIC',55,'','',''),

(4,'Druidic','Hallucinatory Forest','Illusion/Mirage','80''','Permanent','40'' square/lvl','V, S, M','6 segments','None','By casting this spell, the druid creates the illusion of a forest in the spell''s area of effect. Woodland fey and other druids will immediately discern the forest''s illusory nature, but even normal animals will be fooled by the forest''s appearance. The illusion is not tactile, only visual, so it is likely that intelligent beings entering the forest will quickly realize they are walking in an illusion. However, the mere realization that the forest is not real does not dispel the illusion, and it will continue to limit vision and possibly create other inconveniences; horses, for example, will not walk a straight path through the illusion, circling around the "trees" they perceive as real. ','Common','OSRIC',67,'','',''),
(4,'Druidic','Hold Plant','Enchantment/Charm','80''','1 round/lvl','See text','V, S, M','6 segments','Negates','This spell affects plants that can move, whether naturally or as the result of a spell. Plants affected by the spell are frozen in place for the spell''s duration, and if the spell is cast upon normal vegetation (such as dry leaves), these will make no sound other than sounds caused by the wind. In the case of moulds, fungi, and other plants that cannot be considered separately, the spell affects 4-16 square yards of space, as decided by the druid. In the case of plant creatures such as treants, the spell affects between one and four creatures, at the caster''s option.   Depending upon how many creatures (or sq yards of space) the druid targets, the saving throw against the spell is subject to different penalties. If one creature (4 sq yards) is targeted, the saving throw against the spell is made at a penalty of –4; two creatures or 8 sq yards suffer a penalty of –2; three creatures or 12 sq yards suffer a penalty of –1; and four creatures or 16 sq yards suffer no penalty on the saving throw.

The pathway opened by the spell may be up to 5 ft wide, 10 ft high, and up to 120 ft/ caster level in length. The druid may even use the spell to shift inside a tree or move through an area of plants affected by a spell (such as entangle).

Only true insects are affected by the spell, which does not repel spiders, scorpions, beetles or centipedes. Normal insects are completely hedged out by the spell, and giant varieties (2+ HD) must succeed in a saving throw against spells to pass the barrier.

Similarly, if a floor is turned to mud, creatures standing in the area will sink and may be trapped. If dispel magic is cast upon the mud before it eventually dries into dirt, the mud will return to stone, but in the shape and location of the mud (i.e., a collapsed ceiling will not return to its original place; it will be frozen back into stone where it collapsed).

One side of the conflagration emits the searing heat one would expect, but the other side emits merely a gentle warmth. Passing through the flames inflicts 4d4 damage plus 1/ caster level. Creatures as far as ten ft from the hot side of the wall incur 2d4 hit points of damage, and even creatures as far as 20 ft from the fire are burned for 1d4 points of damage. Undead creatures suffer worse from the power of this druidic magic, taking twice the ordinary damage the wall would inflict.   The wall persists for as long as the druid concentrates upon it, or, if the druid does not choose to maintain concentration, will remain for 1 round/ caster level. The druid may evoke a wall of fire in one of two shapes: a wall or a ring. The size of a straight wall is up to one 20 ft square per caster level. A ring has a radius of up to five ft per caster level (with the caster in the centre) and is 20 ft high. If the druid manifests the spell as a wall, the effect is stationary.

The spell reduces a victim into a state of extreme mental retardation, which condition persists until the victim is magically restored by means of a heal, wish, or restoration spell. The different types of spell casting ability are not equally vulnerable to the feeblemind spell.

Transformed acorns may be used as missiles, and transformed holly berries as delayed-action bombs. The spell allows the druid to create four acorn fire seeds or eight holly berry fire seeds, or a proportionate combination such as two acorns and four holly berries. Acorns may be thrown at a range of up to 40 ft and cause 2d8 points of damage in a radius of 5 ft, igniting any combustibles that fail item saving throws. If an acorn strikes its target with a successful to-hit roll, the target is not entitled to a saving throw. Even if the attack misses, the target may be caught in the blast area (and would be entitled to a saving throw for half damage, as any other creature within the blast area). The holly berries may be thrown no more than 6 ft, or may be left in place to ignite upon a command word. (The range of the command word is 40 ft.) Holly berries create an explosion in an area of 5 x 5 ft, inflicting 1d8 points of damage and causing combustible items to make saving throws against magical fire or burn. As with the acorn seeds, a successful saving throw against the explosion of a holly berry fire seed reduces the damage inflicted by one-half. ','Common','OSRIC',60,'','',''),

The spell operates in much the same fashion as pass plant, but with an unlimited range.   When the spell is cast, the druid simply steps into a large plant of any kind and disappears into it. He or she may remain in the first plant for up to 24 hours, but at any time he or she may step forth from another plant of the same species in another location. The druid may know of a specific plant from which he or she wants to emerge, or may simply specify a distance and a direction.

Even very large wooden structures that are not affixed to the ground will be affected, although objects fixed to the ground will manage to withstand the spell''s awesome power. A sapling-sized or smaller piece of wood will splinter and break even if it is firmly affixed.

Running into or attempting to force a way through the thorns will cause 8 hp damage, plus 1 hp for every point of armour class. A creature may be caught within the wall of thorns when the spell is cast, and if this is the case it will take damage immediately and must fight through (taking damage a second time) to gain enough freedom of motion to chop at the thorns. It takes four turns to cut through a 40 ft thickness of a wall of thorns.   Normal fire has no effect upon a wall of thorns, but magical fire can ignite the entire growth, creating a wall of fire (as per the spell) that burns away to nothing in two turns.

The chariot can travel over land at a speed of 240 ft/ round and can fly at a speed of 480 ft/ round, obeying the caster''s shouted instructions. It is possible for the chariot and horses to sustain damage from magical weapons or from water (which does only 1 hp of damage). Chariot and horses each have 30 hp and are AC 2; if a single horse is dispelled by taking physical damage, the chariot''s speed will be halved. The chariot prevents normal fire from affecting its passengers, but they may take damage from magical fire attacks. The chariot and horses are themselves immune to all fire, magical or otherwise.

It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell, but druids are able to cause more of a change than clerics can with the same spell; effectively twice the amount of change is possible for a druid. The druid could not bring heavy rain forth on a clear day, but could change the weather from clear to partly cloudy, and then to fully cloudy (with light rain, perhaps), all in the course of one casting. By comparison, a cleric would only have been able to bring about partial clouds. Hot weather can be made cool, and a strong wind can be raised from calm air.

Only as many insects as are needed to kill an opponent will die, and once the target is dead the swarm will move on. If the druid allows the swarm to get more than 80 ft away from his or her person, 50 insects for every 10 ft beyond this range will depart the swarm. The druid can order the swarm to attack specific targets and/or to change direction.
