If the die roll is less than the victim''s intelligence, the victim realizes that the killer is actually an illusion and cannot be harmed by it. Certain modifiers apply to this roll (note that a negative modifier increases the chance for successfully disbelieving the apparition):    –2 if the target is an illusionist  +1 if the target is caught by surprise  –1 if the target has previously been attacked by a phantasmal killer  The wisdom bonus against mental attacks applies (subtract the bonus from the die roll instead of adding it, of course).

At this level of power, the illusionist can begin to reshape reality by the power of his or her mind. The shadow monsters created by the spell are selected by the caster (subject to the GM''s discretion). The total hit dice of the monsters cannot exceed the caster''s level, and all of them must be the same kind of monster. Shadow monsters have only 20% of normal hit dice (multiply by .2 and round up). Anyone seeing a shadow monster is entitled to a saving throw to realize that the creature is only partially real. If shadow creatures attack someone who fails the saving throw, they strike and inflict damage as the type of creature they appear to be (excluding magical attacks such as breath weapons).

Gazing into the patterns beyond reality is a risky proposition, however; if the result of the die roll is from 2-6, the illusionist becomes obsessed with performing a task, and is treated as being under a geas spell until the random task is completed. If the roll is from 7-9 there is no result at all from the divination; the illusionist discerns no useful patterns, and suffers no ill effects from the attempt. ','Common','OSRIC',115,'','','');
