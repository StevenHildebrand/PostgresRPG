Any fire within the spell’s size limitations may be made as small as a candle flame or turned into a bonfire up to 3 ft in diameter. An affected fire only consumes fuel appropriate to its new size, but will continue to radiate the same heat as a fire of its original size. ','Common','OSRIC',68,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Burning Hands','Transmutation/Alteration','Caster','1 round','3'' long x 120° arc fan','V, S','1 segment','None','While casting this spell, the magic user touches his or her thumbs together, and a sheet of flame explodes from his or her fingers to burn opponents within the spell’s short (3 ft) range. The flames inflict 1 hp of damage per caster level (no saving throw applies). Any combustible items caught in the sheet of flame must pass a saving throw against normal fire or be destroyed.

(1,'Arcane','Charm Person','Enchantment/Charm','120''','See text','1 person','V, S','1 segment','Negates','The powerful enchantment woven by this spell will affect any “person,” meaning character races (but note that elves are 90% resistant), and humanoids (as defined in Chapter V) up to a ceiling of one hit die of charmed creatures per character level at any one time. If the target creature fails a saving throw, it will view the magic user as a trusted friend, interpreting his or her every word in its most positive light.   Charmed creatures will place themselves into moderate danger, including combat, on the caster’s behalf, but will not undertake risks beyond those the creature might ordinarily take. The magic user must be able to talk to the charmed creature if he or she is to give it any sort of complex “request.” Charmed creatures are allowed periodic saving throws to break the charm, based on intelligence:   19+ one saving throw/ day  18 one saving throw/ 2 days  17 one saving throw/ 3 days  15-16 one saving throw/ week  13-14 one saving throw/ 2 weeks  10-12 one saving throw/ 3 weeks  7-9 one saving throw/ month  4-6 one saving throw/ 2 months  3 or less one saving throw/ 3 months   The charm will be broken automatically if the magic user obviously tries to harm the charmed creature.

The spell does not permit the magic user to understand the “speech” of animals; only true, spoken languages can be understood. The caster gains no ability to speak or write the language, only to comprehend meaning. The spell’s reverse makes a particular creature or piece of writing indecipherable, or may be used to cancel the effects of a comprehend languages spell. ','Common','OSRIC',71,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Dancing Lights','Transmutation/Alteration','40'' + 10''/lvl','2 rounds/lvl','See text','V, S, M','1 segment','None','This spell creates small lights at a chosen distance, under the caster’s control. The magic user may create 1-4 (at his or her option) torch-like lights, 1-4 (at his or her option) spherical lights, or a single, faintly human-like glow. The lights move at the caster’s mental command, without any particular concentration required. If the magic user allows the lights to move beyond the spell’s range, the lights will disappear and the spell will end. ','Common','OSRIC',73,'','',''),

(1,'Arcane','Enlarge','Transmutation/Alteration','5''/lvl','1 turn/lvl','1 creature or object','V, S, M','1 segment','Negates','This spell causes a creature or object to grow in size and weight. The spell increases a creature’s size and weight by 20% for each level of the caster (to a maximum increase of 200%) or increases an object’s size and weight by 10% per caster level (to a maximum increase of 100%). The magic user’s power limits the volume of material that he or she can enlarge; the mage can affect no more than 10 cubic ft of living matter, or 5 cubic ft of non-living matter, per level. A normal sized person doubled in size will generally have strength of 18, and tripled in size would have strength of 20+. The spell’s reverse applies in the same ratios, but with the effect of reducing the size of an object or creature. If the spell is cast on an unwilling recipient, a successful saving throw will negate the spell, but willing recipients may choose to forgo the save. ','Common','OSRIC',76,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Erase','Transmutation/Alteration','30''','Instantaneous','1 scroll or 2 pages of writing','V, S','1 segment','See text','This spell may be used to erase normal or magical writing from an area about two pages wide. The base chance to erase a magical writing is 50% + 2%/ caster level, and the base chance to erase non-magical writing is 50% + 4%/ caster level.   Obviously, the main benefit of this spell is that the erasure can be made at a distance. The spell does not remove such magical rune-traps as symbol, glyph of warding or explosive runes (exception: the caster may use it to remove such spells if he or she originally cast them him-or herself). ','Common','OSRIC',76,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Feather Fall','Transmutation/Alteration','10''/lvl','1 segment/lvl','10 cu. ft.','V, M','< 1 segment','None','This spell causes creatures or objects in the area of effect to fall as slowly and lightly as feathers, at a rate of about 10 ft in six seconds (1 segment). No damage is taken from the distance spent falling under the influence of the spell, but it is worthy of note that if the spell’s target has not landed by the time the spell expires, the fall will resume at normal speed and damage will be taken for the remaining distance. The magic user can affect a weight of up to 200 lbs plus another 200 lbs/ caster level. The spell may be used to slow propelled objects such as arrows, but will not affect sword blows or other non-propelled forces.','Common','OSRIC',77,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Find Familiar','Conjuration/Summoning','0','See text','1 mile radius/lvl','V, S, M','2d12 hours','See text','Magic users of higher level often summon familiars to assist them with various tasks. Indeed, a familiar can also be of considerable benefit to a lower level magic user (even increasing others’ estimation of his or her power), but the risks inherent in losing a familiar can be daunting to a weaker spell caster. To summon a familiar, the magic user must intone the words of the spell over a well-stocked fire source, sprinkling the flames with expensive incense and powders (100 gp in total value). The caster must maintain his or her casting for as long as necessary (2d12 hours) until a familiar arrives (or the casting time expires without success). The spell may be attempted only once per year, and the caster has no control over the type of animal that will respond. When it arrives, the familiar is a faithful servant and ally to the caster. Normal familiars have 1d3+1 hit points, are AC 7, and are as intelligent as a lower-than-average human. When the familiar is within 120 ft of the magic user, the magic user gains additional hit points equal to the familiar’s. However, if the familiar is ever killed, the magic user permanently loses twice the familiar’s hit points.   caster level   1-2           3-5         6-8         9-11      12-14       15+       familiar  01-05     01-05    01-06    01-06    01-07    01-07    Special  06-25     06-25    07-29    07-29    08-33    08-33    Cat  26-35      26-36    30-40    30-41    34-45    34-46    Hawk  36-45      37-47    41-51      42-53    46-57    47-59     Owl  46-55      48-58    52-62     54-65    58-69     60-72    Raven  56-65      59-69     63-73     66-77     70-81    73-85     Toad  66-75      70-80    74-84    78-89     82-93    86-98     Weasel  76-00     81-00    85-00   90-00   94-00   99-00    None   A special familiar is entitled to a saving throw in order to avoid  the effect of the spell. The type of special familiar to appear  depends upon the magic user’s alignment:   Lawful good or Lawful neutral: Brownie  Chaotic good, Neutral good, or Neutral: Pseudo-dragon  Lawful evil or Neutral evil: Imp  Chaotic evil or Chaotic Neutral: Quasit     ','Common','OSRIC',78,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Floating Disc','Invocation/Evocation','20''','3 turns + 1 turn/lvl','See text','V, S, M','1 segment','None','This evocation produces an invisible disk about three ft across, shaped like a shallow bowl. The disk floats in the air and moves in accordance with the caster’s commands (although if it is allowed more than 20 ft from the caster it will disappear). The disk cannot move faster than 60 ft per round. A floating disk can carry up to 100 lbs per level of the caster. ','Uncommon','OSRIC',79,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Friends','Enchantment/Charm','Caster','1 round/lvl','10'' radius + 10''/lvl','V, S, M','1 segment','See text','This spell increases the magic user’s charisma in the eyes of all creatures within the area of effect that fail saving throws. For these creatures, the magic user’s charisma will effectively be increased by 2d4 (one roll for all). For those who succeed in making the saving throw, the caster’s charisma will effectively be lowered by 1d4.   Unless the exact numbers are required for some purpose, the normal result of the spell will be that those who failed the  saving throw will be well-disposed and friendly toward the caster, and those that succeeded in making the save will find him or her distasteful and somewhat suspect. ','Common','OSRIC',80,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Hold Portal','Transmutation/Alteration','20''/lvl','1 round/lvl','1 portal < 80 sq.ft./lvl','V','1 segment','None','This quickly-shouted spell holds fast a door or similar aperture as if it were securely locked. The portal must be something that normally opens and closes, such as a door, gate, valve, or portcullis, and it must be closed for the spell to function. A magically held portal can be battered apart, but will not open normally until the spell’s duration expires. This is not a particularly powerful spell; any being not native to the material planes (such as a demon) will ignore its effects, as will a magic user four or more levels higher than the caster. The spell may also be negated by means of a knock or dispel magic. ','Common','OSRIC',83,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Identify','Divination','Touch','1 segment/lvl','1 item','V, S, M','1 turn','See text','This expensive and unreliable spell allows the magic user to discern the magical properties of an item. The magic user must hold or wear the item as intended for use (thereby placing himself at risk of a cursed item). For every segment of the spell’s duration, the magic user has a 15% +5%/ caster level of gaining an insight into the nature of the item’s enchantment. Insights include magical effects (and the corresponding command word) and number of charges (plus or minus 25% of the actual number). The exact bonus (or penalty) of a weapon is not revealed to the player, unless the GM chooses to do so for convenience; the character, of course, would not think of a magic sword as being “+1” or “+3,” just as “enchanted” or “powerfully enchanted,” and the spell reveals information in these terms. The spell must be cast within 1 hour/ caster level of the time a magic item first comes near the caster, or the magic user’s own aura will have blended too much into the item’s aura, contaminating his ability to read it. Upon casting the spell, the magic user temporarily loses 8 points of constitution, and regains them by resting for one hour per recovered point. The material component for the spell is a pearl worth 100 gp.','Common','OSRIC',84,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Jump','Transmutation/Alteration','Touch','See text','1 creature','V, S, M','1 segment','None','This spell allows the subject to make one or more prodigious leaps, one additional leap for each three caster levels above 1. Thus, at a caster level of 4, the spell permits a second leap, with additional leaps at level 7, 10, 13, etc. The recipient of the spell may bound forward 30 ft, or may leap backward or straight up for a distance of 10 ft. The leap is almost perfectly straight, with no arc.','Common','OSRIC',85,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Light','Transmutation/Alteration','60''','1 turn/lvl','20'' radius globe','V, S','1 segment','None','Other than as noted above, this spell is identical to the clerical spell light. ','Common','OSRIC',86,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Magic Aura','Illusion/Mirage','Touch','1 day/lvl','See text','V, S, M','1 round','None','This spell creates a false magical aura around a single object of not more than five lbs per caster level. A detect magic spell will incorrectly perceive the item as magical, but if it is actually handled by the caster of the detect magic spell, he or she will be permitted a saving throw to realize that the aura is, in fact, not a true magical aura but a counterfeit. ','Uncommon','OSRIC',88,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Magic Missile','Invocation/Evocation','60'' + 10''/lvl','Instantaneous','1+ creatures in 10''x10'' area','V, S','1 segment','None','When this spell is cast, missiles of magical energy dart forth from the caster’s fingertips, striking unerringly at his or her intended target(s), even if the target(s) are in melee or are partially concealed. The missiles inflict 1d4+1 points of damage each. For every two caster levels beyond first, the caster gains an additional missile; thus, a first-level magic user can cast one missile, a third-level caster may cast 2, a fifth-level caster may cast 3, and so on. ','Common','OSRIC',88,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Mending','Transmutation/Alteration','30''','Instantaneous','1 object','V, S, M','1 segment','None','This spell repairs small breaks or tears in an object. It can weld together broken metallic objects, such as a chain link or a broken dagger, rejoin a broken bottle, and repair holes in leather or cloth, for example. The spell does not repair magic items in any way that would restore or affect their magical qualities. ','Common','OSRIC',89,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Message','Transmutation/Alteration','60'' + 10''/lvl','5 segments + 1 segment/lvl','See text','V, S, M','1 segment','None','Once this spell is cast, the magic user may point to any creature in range and whisper a message that the other creature will hear. If there is time remaining, the recipient may whisper a message in reply. Only one creature may be in contact with the caster at a time, but if time allows, the caster may make contact with more than one possible recipient. The gestures of this spell are subtle, and it is easy to conceal that the enchantment is being cast. Note that the path between the magic user and the recipient must be a straight line and not completely blocked. ','Common','OSRIC',89,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Protection from Evil','Abjuration','Touch','2 rounds/lvl','1 creature','V, S, M','1 segment','None','Other than as noted above, this spell is identical to the clerical spell protection from evil.','Common','OSRIC',96,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Push','Conjuration/Summoning','10'' + 3''/lvl','Instantaneous','See text','V, S, M','1 segment','None','The magic user casts this spell and points toward the desired target, which is instantly pushed away from the caster. The supernatural force exerted by the spell is only about one lb per level of the caster, but the spell can be used to move small objects or to throw enemies off balance. A small object can be moved at a rate of 10 ft/ round (directly away from the caster), and if the object is a weapon held by a creature, the creature will suffer a penalty to hit equal to the caster’s level. For example, a tenth level magic user could exert so much eldritch force against an attacking orc’s axe that the orc would suffer a –10 to hit with it. Moving an actual creature or a heavier object is only possible if the creature’s weight in lbs is not more than 50 times the caster’s level. ','Common','OSRIC',96,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Read Magic','Divination','Caster','2 rounds/lvl','Caster','V, S, M','1 round','None','Read magic is normally the first spell in every magic user’s spell book, and its mastery is the first task of every apprentice. The spell allows the caster to read magical writings (other than his or her own, of course, which are always intelligible to the original author).   Unless the writings are cursed, reading magical script does not normally activate the magic formulae described therein— reviewing a scroll prior to casting from it does not, for instance, actually cast whatever spell is written upon the scroll. Once the magic user has read a particular set of magical inscriptions by use of this spell, the spell is no longer needed to re-read the writing at a later time.   The reverse of the spell allows the magic user to make magical writings indecipherable for the spell’s duration, and is cast upon the writing rather than upon the caster him-or herself.','Common','OSRIC',97,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Shield','Invocation/Evocation','Caster','5 rounds/lvl','See text','V, S','1 segment','None','By means of this spell, the caster creates an invisible barrier of magical force. Magic missiles cannot penetrate the barrier at all. The magic user gains an armour class of 2 against any hurled weapon, armour class of 3 against propelled weapons such as arrows, and armour class of 4 against all other attacks. All saving throws against frontal attacks (by wands, dragon breath, etc.) are made at +1 during the spell’s duration. The shield is a frontal defence and grants no benefits against attacks from behind or from the rear flanks. ','Common','OSRIC',98,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Shocking Grasp ','Transmutation/Alteration','Touch','1 round','1 creature','V, S','1 segment','None','This spell imbues the caster’s hand with a powerful electrical charge that the magic user may use to deliver a deadly shock. The electrical charge can be delivered either by a direct touch (requiring a successful attack roll) or through a conductive material such as metal. This spell is not powerful enough to deliver a dangerous shock through any significant volume of water, but a small quantity of water (a shallow puddle, for instance) could be used as a suitable conductor. The shocking grasp inflicts 1d8 hp of damage, +1 hp per level of the caster. ','Common','OSRIC',99,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Sleep','Enchantment/Charm','30'' + 10''/lvl','5 rounds/lvl','See text','V, S, M','1 segment','None','This spell affects a circular area with a 15 ft radius. A number of creatures within this radius (determined by their HD) fall into a deep magical slumber with no saving throw allowed. Magically sleeping creatures may be killed or tied up at a rate of one per round by a single person, or can be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit for maximum damage, if the attacker chooses not to kill or bind them. A sleeping creature requires a full round to waken and must be shaken or slapped to bring it to consciousness; mere noise, however loud, will not disturb the enchanted slumber of a sleep spell’s victim. The number of enemies affected by the spell is a function of their hit dice. If there are creatures of different hit dice in the area, the weaker ones will be affected first. Creatures with hit dice over 4+4 are not affected by the spell.  hit dice of Victim number affected  1 or less 4d4  1+ to 2 2d4  2+ to 3 1d4  3+ to 4 1d2  4+1 to 4+4 0 or 1 (d2-1) ','Common','OSRIC',99,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Spider Climb','Transmutation/Alteration','Touch','1 round + 1 round/lvl','1 creature','V, S, M','1 segment','None','When the magic user casts this spell, the recipient’s bare hands and feet become sticky enough to allow him or her to climb walls and even crawl along a ceiling. The movement rate for such climbing is 30 ft per round. The subject of this spell will find it difficult to employ tools or handle small objects with precision while the spell is in effect.

(1,'Arcane','Unseen Servant','Conjuration/Summoning','Caster','6 turns + 1 turn/lvl','30'' radius around caster','V, S, M','1 segment','None','By means of this spell, the caster summons a mindless magical force to perform simple tasks. The servant can fetch and carry things, open doors, hold chairs, clean, mend, etc. It will continue at its assigned task until it is given another command. An unseen servant cannot exert force of more than twenty lbs. Unseen servants can neither attack nor move beyond the spell’s area of effect. ','Common','OSRIC',104,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Ventriloquism','Illusion/Mirage','10''/level (max 60'')','2 rounds + 1 round/lvl','1 object','V, M','1 segment','See text','The caster makes his or her voice (or any sound he or she can vocalize) seem to issue from someplace else, such as from another creature, a statue, from behind a door, down a passage, etc. For each point of intelligence of the listener over 12, there is a cumulative 10% chance to correctly perceive the source of the sound. ','Common','OSRIC',104,'','',''),
(1,'Arcane','Write','Invocation/Evocation','Caster','1 hour/lvl','Caster','V, S, M','1 round','None','This spell enables the magic user to make a written copy of a spell he or she cannot yet cast, a somewhat dangerous proposition. In order to succeed in this task, the caster must make a saving throw vs spells, with a modifier determined by the difficulty of the spell being transcribed. If the spell is up to one level higher than the magic user can cast, the saving throw is made at +2. If the spell is two levels higher than the magic user can cast, there is no bonus or penalty to the saving throw. If the spell is more than 2 levels higher than the magic user can cast, each additional level adds a –1 penalty. If the magic user fails this saving throw, the spell is not successfully copied, the caster takes 1d4 points of damage for each level of the spell, and he or she is knocked unconscious for 1 turn per hit point sustained thereby. The damage sustained cannot be healed more quickly than 4 hp per day, even with the assistance of magical healing. If the saving throw is successful, the magic user may copy the spell, which takes one hour per level of the spell. The material component is ink costing at least 200 gp.

(2,'Arcane','Audible Glamour','Illusion/Mirage','60'' + 10''/lvl','2 rounds/lvl','Hearing distance','V, M','2 segments','See text','This spell is, as its name suggests, the creation of illusory sounds. The caster designates a focal point for the spell, which must, of course, be within the spell’s range. The focal point can be moved by the caster at will until the spell’s duration expires. The spell can create any type of sound, but the maximum volume of the noise depends upon the caster’s level. A third level caster can produce the noise of 4 people shouting (or acting more quietly). Each additional caster level allows the caster to add the sound of four more people into the illusion. As a benchmark, the sound of an explosion or landslide would require a caster level of approximately 8th. Listeners are only entitled to saving throws if they have cause to doubt the apparent sounds. Players must state such disbelief, while the GM will make such determinations for monsters and NPCs based on the plausibility of the audible glamour. ','Common','OSRIC',69,'','',''),

In all respects, the spell is identical to the first level cleric spell light, but its effects are permanent until dispelled.

(2,'Arcane','Detect Evil','Divination','Caster','5 rounds/lvl','10'' x 60'' path','V, S','2 segments','None','This spell allows the magic user to detect emanations of evil (or good, in the case of the spell’s reverse) within the spell’s area of effect, a beam-like pathway. The spell detects evil, not danger, so it will be useless to discover such things as a mindless trap or a poisoned wineglass. Neither will it detect a cursed item unless the nature of the curse is such that the cursed item becomes inherently evil. ','Common','OSRIC',74,'','',''),

The caster need not be able to see the creature whose thoughts he is reading; the spell can be used to listen beyond a closed door.

(2,'Arcane','Fool''s Gold','Transmutation/Alteration','10''','6 turns/lvl','1 cu. ft./lvl','V, S, M','1 round','None','This spell achieves the much sought-after goal of transmuting copper or brass into gold. Regrettably, the effect is temporary, but an amoral caster might seek to shift the consequent feelings of regret onto another person than him-or herself. Whatever motives drive the caster, he or she may use this spell to transmute roughly 2,000 copper coins (about a cubic foot) per caster level into a metal that closely resembles gold. Anyone viewing this metal has a chance to notice that it is not truly gold. If the result of d20 plus the caster’s level is equal to or less than the observer’s intelligence, the fraud is detected (the GM may pick a representative number for creatures whose exact intelligence is not known, or roll a die). By combining expensive material components with the spell, the caster can make it more likely that the gold will seem true—conversely, there are mundane methods that give a chance to detect this very spell, such as striking the “gold” with cold iron (10% chance of changing the metal back). The GM will decide for his or her campaign exactly what can be done to improve and detect this spell. ','Common','OSRIC',79,'','',''),

The spell obliterates memory of the last round plus one additional round per three caster levels. The caster decides which creatures in the spell’s area to affect, and these must make saving throws or suffer the loss of memory. The caster may designate 1-4 creatures as the targets of the spell. If one is targeted, the saving throw is made with a –2 penalty; if two are targeted, the penalty is –1; and if 3 or 4 creatures are targeted they suffer no penalty to the saving throw.

The amount of reduction is increased by 1%/ caster level (to be rounded off in the case of lower-level magic users simply as a matter of convenience). Thus, if an orc is struck with the ray by a level one magic user, the orc would lose 26% (rounded to 25%, at the option of the GM) of its strength. Its to-hit rolls are not affected, but any damage it inflicts is reduced to 75% (or 74%) of the damage rolled (a good GM avoids minuscule calculations that might bog down the game). A ray of enfeeblement may technically reduce the target’s strength below the required minimum to qualify for a class, but its effects are too temporary to affect  class choices (so an enfeebled paladin with a temporary strength of 8 retains his or her paladinhood).

Any creature in the area must make a saving throw at a penalty of –2. The effect of a successful saving throw depends upon how close the target is to the edge of the area of effect; if the creature is within five ft of the edge of the spell’s area of effect, the creature has jumped free and is not affected by the web. If the creature is not within five ft of the edge and makes its save, that creature will be able to fight its way through the web at twice normal speed (at a rate of 1 ft per turn if its strength is less than 13) and will have no chance of suffocating. No creature within the area of effect, whether a saving throw is made or not, can cast spells or attack. Any creature that fails its saving throw has a cumulative 5% chance of suffocating per turn.

The segment in which the magic user disappears and reappears is determined on 2d4, while the compass direction is rolled on a d8. If the direction roll would result in the caster being teleported into a solid object, the caster will blink a second time, for a distance of no more than 10 ft. If this second blink also results in the caster occupying a solid object, the spell will end, marooning the caster in the æthereal plane of existence.

The caster may only be attacked directly if the attack is made before the blink takes place. If the caster teleports both from and into an area which is affected by an area of effect spell, he will suffer its effects.

Creatures making successful saving throws suffer only half the indicated damage. When the magic user casts the spell, a bead of light streaks from his or her pointed finger to the target area, and if it strikes another object directly in its path the fireball will detonate immediately. The blast fills the entire volume of the spell radius, and if it is cast into an enclosed area smaller than the area of effect the flames will expand from this area until the spell’s full volume has been reached. The volume of a 20 ft radius sphere is approximately 33,500 cubic ft, and there are 1,000 cubic ft in a 10 x 10 x 10 ft area, so in an area with a 10 ft ceiling the fireball will fill approximately thirty-three 10 x 10 ft squares. Thus, if a fireball explodes in the middle of a corridor 10 ft wide and 10 ft high, the blast will extend a staggering 165 ft in both directions. It is quite possible, particularly in dungeoneering environments, for the magic user to be caught in the backblast of his or her own fireball spell.

The magic user decides how many of his or her foes  he or she will target with the spell: if there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –3, if two, each makes the saving throw at –1, and if the magic user seeks to hold three or four enemies, each makes his or her saving throw with no penalty.   Creatures affected by this spell would include humans, demihumans and humanoids. Ultimately, it is in the discretion of the GM to decide if a creature is considered a “person” for the purposes of this spell. If a magic item or spell operates to partially negate the effects of paralysis, failure on the saving throw will have the effect of a slow spell rather than completely immobilising the target.

The bolt deals 1d6 damage per caster level to all creatures standing in the bolt’s area of effect. Creatures that make successful saving throws suffer half damage. The area of effect may be either a branching, forking maelstrom of electricity 10 ft wide and 40 ft long, or it may be a concentrated blast 5 ft wide and 80 ft long. The length of the bolt itself is not affected by the caster’s level, only the range at which the caster may cause the bolt to originate.

The illusion is dispelled if it is struck with a blow, a falling person, etc. There is no saving throw against the illusion if the observer believes it, and the illusion can actually cause damage to such a deceived victim. A demon wielding a sword can attack and do damage, and the appearance of a pit full of spikes can be fatal even though it is not real. If the observer doubts the reality of the illusion, he or she will be permitted a saving throw to see the illusion for what it really is. If one observer disbelieves the illusion and this disbelief is communicated to others, the others will also gain a saving throw at a bonus of +4.   Note that the spell relies purely on a visual effect; it will have no effect upon a creature that does not see it. Furthermore, the lack of any audible component can make certain illusions completely non-credible. An explosion, for example, is not likely to be believed by anyone if it creates no sound. Various methods may be used by the GM to determine if an NPC or monster believes the effect of a phantasmal force, common sense being the first thing to consider.

(5,'Arcane','Magic Jar','Enchantment/Charm','10''/lvl','See text','1 creature','V, S, M','1 round','Negates','This risky spell allows the caster to transfer his or her mind into that of another creature, trapping the other creature’s soul in a gem (of not less than 100 gp value) that is the material component of the spell and becomes the magic jar. To accomplish the transfer of souls, the magic user must trap his or her own life essence within the jar prior to the transfer. If the transfer fails (e.g., if the targeted creature makes a successful saving throw), the caster’s soul is trapped until it can take over a host or otherwise escape.   The caster can make successive attempts to take over the same host, but no more than one per round. The spell’s range applies to two matters; when the magic user first transfers his or her own life essence into the jar, his or her body must be within the spell’s range of the jar. The range also limits the distance at which the magic user’s soul may later escape from the jar and into another body. After the caster’s soul moves into the jar, his or her physical body becomes inert and lifeless.   The spell represents, in many ways, a contest of will between the magic user and the creature whose body he or she seeks to possess. The caster and the target creature each total their intelligence and wisdom scores (such being calculated or approximated by the GM for a monster). This combined score represents the character’s mental power for purposes of the spell. The two numbers are compared, and the difference is used in two important calculations: the saving throw and the chance for escape. One third of the difference (rounded down) is the modifier on the saving throw, a bonus if the target creature has the higher mental power, a penalty if the magic user’s mental power is higher.   If a creature’s soul is trapped in the magic jar by the caster, it has a chance to escape. If it escapes, the caster’s soul is returned to the magic jar. If the difference in mental power  between the caster and the possessed creature is 4 or less in favour of the caster, or is in favour of the possessed creature, the creature can attempt a new saving throw every round. If the difference is from 5 to 8 in the caster’s favour, one saving throw is permitted per turn. If the difference is 9 to 12 in the caster’s favour, the saving throw is made once per day, and if the caster’s mental power exceeds that of the target creature by 13+, the saving throw can only be made once per week.   While the caster is in the magic jar waiting to possess another body, he or she can sense creatures beyond the jar, but not their nature. The jar may be moved from its original location, but not, obviously, by the caster. When the caster possesses another body, he or she gains complete control of its movement and acquires any memories that the body might reflexively recall (how to fly, fight with claws, use innate magical powers, etc). He or she does not gain any knowledge from the creature’s mind, such as languages known or the location of a lair, for the mind is trapped in the magic jar.

Before the spell can actually be cast, the magic user must engage in considerable time-consuming and meticulous work, or the spell will certainly fail.   Firstly, the item itself must be of absolutely the finest quality available, in terms of craftsmanship, although it need not necessarily be fancy. In most cases, special components such as powders or threads will be incorporated into the item’s construction, costing not less than 100 gp. The casting of the spell takes 1d8+2 days, with the caster working steadily upon the item for eight hours per day. No other spells may be cast during this period of time, nor can the magic user engage in any other meaningful work. When the final words of the spell are spoken, the item makes a saving throw against spells at the same level as the magic user, but with success on the saving throw indicating that the spell has succeeded. A natural result of 1 on this roll always indicates failure of the spell. At this point, the magic user may begin to infuse the item with enchantments, each of which requires 5d8 hours to complete. Most magic items will require unusual components; dragon scales or blood for a sword with an unusually high bonus against dragons, for example. The GM will determine exactly what is required for any particular magic item.   This spell is not permanent unless a permanency spell is cast upon it; the duration of the enchantment may be for a year or more without a permanency spell, but the enchantment will eventually fail if it is not locked in to the item.

When the caster speaks the first words of the scroll in the fiend’s presence, the demon is immediately held in place (unless its innate magic resistance allows it to escape this effect). Even if the fiend’s magic resistance protects it, the words of the scroll cause considerable agony, and if the creature has the ability to escape it is only 10% likely to remain and try to stop the final reading (0% likelihood if it has no means of attacking the magic user, gaining possession of the scroll, or otherwise influencing events in its favour).

The spell may be used to grant minor wishes (undoing curses, granting small quantities of gold, duplicating the effects of lower level spells, etc.) The effects of the spell will be permanent for most minor requests, particularly when used to duplicate a lower-level spell that has a permanent or instantaneous duration.   However, a limited wish is not powerful enough to make major changes in reality. It cannot bring the dead back to life, grant a level, or permanently change ability scores. In many cases, the GM will be called upon to determine whether the caster’s wish is within the power of a limited wish spell or whether the results of the request will suffer from flaws due to the spell’s limitations. Flaws would include limited durations or partial results. The guidelines set forth above should give the GM some assistance in making such determinations.   In the case of unreasonable wishes, the GM may decide to follow the wording of the spell precisely but pervert the intent, limit the duration of the spell to a very limited time (perhaps mere seconds!) or simply rule that the whole spell fails.   The guideline here is that wishes are granted by someone or something, which may or may not be kindly disposed to the player characters.

The caster retains his or her own mind and hit points, but assumes the magical properties of the shape-changed form as well as its physical capabilities. The spell does not allow the caster to assume the form of any greater creature native to another plane of existence, but virtually any other form can be assumed, from a tree to an insect to a treasure chest to a dragon. The material component of the spell is a piece of jewellery worth 5,000 gp. ','Common','OSRIC',98,'','',''),

The victim does not age or change in any way and does not need to breathe or eat. The sleep lasts until the victim is awakened by the use of dispel magic or the spell’s reverse form.','Common','OSRIC',102,'','',''),
(9,'Arcane','Time Stop','Transmutation/Alteration','10''','1 segment/2 lvls + 1d8 segments','15'' radius sphere','V','9 segments','None','This spell allows the caster to act between two moments of time, in a bubble where the outside is frozen in place, not moving in the flow of time’s passage. The spell’s common name is a misnomer, for time does not actually stop; rather the caster simply gains a few “extra” moments, captured in between the points of time’s normal passage. Effectively, the caster simply gains the duration of the spell as extra time in which he or she may perform whatever actions he or she wishes, while the rest of the universe is effectively frozen relative to the caster.

(9,'Arcane','Wish','Conjuration/Summoning','Unlimited','Varies','Varies','V','Varies','Varies','A wish spell is the true version of limited wish, an extraordinarily potent invocation of eldritch power. After casting a wish spell, the caster will be weakened considerably, requiring 2d4 days of bed rest. The only exception to this is when the wish is used for transport, healing, or resurrection of the dead. In general, the exact wording of the wish is carried out regardless of its intent, but the GM will not normally be stringent upon this point unless the wish is an attempt to overreach the spell’s power.   In the case of unreasonable wishes, the GM may decide to follow the wording of the spell precisely but pervert the intent, limit the duration of the spell to a very limited time (perhaps mere seconds!) or simply rule that the whole spell fails.   The guideline here is that wishes are granted by someone or something, which may or may not be kindly disposed to the player characters. The more greedy or selfish a wish, the greater the chance that a mischievous or actually evil power will take the opportunity to teach this upstart mortal a lesson.
